## Meet Brudencar, the CalHacks4.0 Project.

We created a chatbot that learned from its conversations with people and offered new ways to interact with the world.

## Small Talk

Brudencar keeps enriching its responses better based on the conversations it has.

## Summarize the news

By asking the keywords like "about," "news," "on," and "regarding," Brudencar returns the summary of the lastest news to you.

## More Features

We are making this chatbot more entertained. There will be more features added on.
