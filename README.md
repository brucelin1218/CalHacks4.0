## Meet Brudencar, a CalHacks4.0 Project.

We created a chatbot that learned from its conversations with people and offered new ways to interact with the world.

### Small Talk

Brudencar continually enriches its responses based on the conversations it has with users.

### Summarize the News

By asking the keywords like "about," "news," "on," and "regarding," Brudencar returns the summary of the lastest news to you.

### More Features

Brudencar is an ongoing project. Our goal is to continue updating Brudencar to be more entertaining and functional. More features are to come!
